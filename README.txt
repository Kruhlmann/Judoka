  <h1>Judoka</h1>
  <h3>Intro</h3>
  Judoka is my very first game. It's inspired by every other 2D fighting game from the old days however, it is based 
  around Judo, which means, that hitting and kicking is NOT allowed. Instead, you must rely on throwing the opponent.
  <h3>How to play</h3>
  Choose a friend/enemy to play aginst. One player controls with the arrow keys and 'enter' button. The other player uses 
  WASD and the 'space' key. When in the game, you have to approach your opponent to grab the opponent. Once both players 
  are gripping you may attempt an attack. The throws are determined from the character you create (COMING SOON). To throw
  your opponent either drag him towards you or push against him. Then press your action key (enter / space). Optionally 
  you can press up or down for a different throw. All throws have unique attributes, and they are for you to explore.
